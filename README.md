## üß† Project Overview

**PneumaTect** is an AI-powered platform designed to assist in the early detection and classification of pulmonary nodules using advanced deep learning algorithms. The solution aims to improve diagnostic accuracy, reduce radiologist workload, and support clinical decisions in lung cancer management.

Pulmonary nodules may indicate lung cancer‚Äîone of the deadliest diseases globally. This platform leverages state-of-the-art medical imaging techniques and AI-driven analysis to classify nodules into normal, benign, or malignant types, and further sub-type lung cancers.
